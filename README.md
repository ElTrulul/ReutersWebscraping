# ReutersWebscraping
This repo fetches financial data for selected companies from Reuters website

### The Problem
You typically conduct three analyzing steps before making a final investment decision:
1) Understanding the basics of the company (business model/products/latest news/forecast/market development)
2) Checking the candidate's financial figures and their development over time
3) Assessing the fit to your personal portfolio in terms of diversification / investment strategy.
4) Investigating the current stock price

After conducting step 1) - 3) you already should have made an investment decision depending on the stock price (e.g. "This company is interesting for me, if I get a stock for a price below XX EUR, I am going to buy it"). Then you conduct step 4) and make a decision.
If you have just one candidate, you might go to Thomas Reuters and browse all the information needed.

But the problem is - especially for beginners - that you do not have just one candidate, you have plenty. Where should you put your money in? It would be great to select "the best" candidates from your pre-selected watchlist. For each company on Reuters, the information is spread over several subdomains, in different currencies or number formats and this annoying feature makes it hard to draw comparisons. 

## The Solution
Having a standardized table with all the updated information from Reuters to conduct further comparative analyses would be great.
